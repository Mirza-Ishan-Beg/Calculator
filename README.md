### Simple Calculator Website

The website will have functionality (buttons) of -
1. [X] Basic Add, Subtract, divide, etc.
2. [X] Basic JS script.
3. [ ] Basic CSS script.

The next step will be adding ability to do simple linear equations. 
example: f(x) = mx + c
(Where we will take user input and give corresponding resultant as an output.)
